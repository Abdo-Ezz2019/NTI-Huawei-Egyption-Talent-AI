🩺 Diabetes Classification using KNN (Best K Selection)
This project demonstrates how to classify diabetes outcomes using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It includes automatic tuning of the number of neighbors (K) to find the best-performing model using accuracy as the evaluation metric.

📌 Features
✅ Load and clean diabetes dataset

✅ Rename columns generically for preprocessing

✅ Train/test split (75% / 25%)

✅ Loop over multiple K values (1 to 8)

✅ Visualize accuracy vs. K for both training and testing sets

✅ Use confusion matrix for model evaluation

📊 Dataset Overview
Dataset: diabetes.csv
Target: Outcome (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)
Features: 8 numeric medical features (Pregnancies, Glucose, BMI, etc.)

🔢 Model Workflow
Preprocessing:

Generic renaming of columns to remove headers

Feature matrix X and target vector y extracted

Training Process:

Train models with K = 1 to 8

Evaluate training and testing accuracy for each

Plot results to visualize overfitting/underfitting

Best K Selection:
